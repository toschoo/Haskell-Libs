MDaemon 6.8 PRO!}}\end{center}With \textsl{Bayesian filtering}, each email site decides what is spam and legitimate email by dragging and dropping examples of both into the filtering engine. The filter then compares the content of the examples to the content of new messages to separate spam from real mail. Given several hundred examples of each type, Bayesian filtering is more than 95 percent accurate on spam, with virtually zero mistakes for important email.\textsl{Heuristic spam detection} uses feature-matching rules --- red HTML text, for example --- to identify spam. Through years of ``learning'' what spam (and legitimate) messages typically look like, the heuristic rules have become very reliable in separating spam from normal email.MDaemon supports multiple means of fighting spam, including assured access through white lists.For more information on stopping spam with MDaemon, see the \href{http://www.altn.com/support/white\_papers.asp?product\_id=MDaemon#8}{\emph{Security Tools for Spam Control}} white paper, the \href{http://files.altn.com/HowTo/}{MDaemon AntiSpam HowTos} and the \href{http://files.altn.com/HowTo/SpamFilteringTutorialZS.pdf}{AntiSpam tutorial}, by Ross McWilliam.\parskip = 10pt\begin{center}\hypertarget{ssltutorial}{\textbf{{\Large SSL How To's}}}\end{center}\parskip = 5ptThe Secure Socket Layer (SSL) can protect your MDaemon email communications on the Internet by using:\parskip = 0pt\begin{itemize}\parskip = 0pt\item server authentication certificates\item data encryption\item personal authentication certificates\end{itemize}An authentication certificate resides on your server and makes sure your users are communicating with your server only.\parskip = 5ptData encryption converts ordinary data into codes only the sender and receiver software can understand.A personal authentication certificate resides on a client computer and verifies the identify and ownership of the client computer. MDaemon can use SSL for its IMAP, POP, SMTP and WorldClient webmail functions. Setting up SSL for email and webmail are individual and independent processes.

White lists and exclusion lists help make sure security scanning does not accidentally block or hinder the delivery of critical legitimate email. MDaemon uses \textsl{white lists} for it's \textsl{Spam Blocker} and \textsl{Spam Filter}. For the \textsl{Spam Blocker} you can enter the email addresses you always want to exclude from black list processing. \textsl{Spam Filtering} uses numeric ``scoring'' for deciding if a message is spam --- a higher ``score'' means a message is more likely spam. While white lists for the \textsl{Spam Filter} contain IP addresses not likely to be spam sources, the filter still processes messages from the white listed sites. However, the white listed sites start out weighted heavily against being spam sources. A message from a white listed site has to be very obviously spam before it is filtered out.MDaemon uses \textsl{exclusion lists} for various types of server security. Sites on exclusion lists are trusted and receive no security scanning at all.  The \textsl{Spam Filter} has an exclusion list. Other security measures with exclusion lists include:\textsl{Relay Settings.} Trusted Hosts are exempted from the relay restrictions. See the \textsl{Security \gt\ Relay / Trust\dots} command, the \textsl{Trusted Hosts} tab.\textsl{IP Screening.} Sites can be specifically prohibited or permitted to connect. For example the range \texttt{192.168.*.*}  can be prohibited, but the single address \texttt{192.168.1.108} can be permitted. See the \textsl{Security \gt\ Address suppression\dots} command, the \textsl{IP Screening} tab.You can set up white lists and exclusion lists for single addresses and for ranges of addresses. Examples include: \texttt{192.168.1.108} for a single address and \texttt{192.168.*.*} for a range of addresses.\\\hyperlink{contents}{{\small Back to Contents}}\end{multicols}\framebox{\begin{minipage}[t]{.99\linewidth}\begin{center}\hypertarget{security}{\textbf{{\Large Server Security Basics}}}\end{center}\parskip = 5ptA few MDaemon settings can protect your server from unauthorized access.
