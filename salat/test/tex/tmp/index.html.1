<h2>The TeX showcase</h2>

<p>This is the TeX showcase, edited by <strong>Gerben Wierda</strong>. It
contains examples of what you can do with TeX, the typesetting engine from
Donald Knuth, world famous mathematician, computer scientist and above all
well known for TeX. I will try to keep this showcase small. For remarks on
submissions, see at the end of this document.</p>

<p> In this showcase, you will not only find examples of material prepared
with TeX proper, but also with macro packages like LaTeX, ConTeXt and with
related programs like METAPOST. And though TeX is a typesetting language, you
will find graphics and even an MPEG movie. </p>

<p>Showcases are mostly PDF files. Some PDF files contain tricks that only
work in certain PDF-viewers, e.g. they might contain automatic changes in the
page that work in certain versions of Acrobat and only when certain
preferences are set. The descriptions will contain special instructions if
any.</p>

<p>Most examples come with some sort of source. <em>These sources are not
guaranteed to compile, they are only there for visual inspection.</em> Some
may compile, but some may have parts missing.</p>

<p>  Some of these examples were prepared using proprietary fonts or
  software that must be purchased.  For a discussion of font usage with
  TeX, including a sampler of available free fonts, please see this
  <a href="/fonts/">separate font page</a>.
</p>

<p>One word on the sections. These are generated automatically from a database
and their titles speak for themselves.  The exception is the section <i>Yannis
Haralambous</i>. Yannis is famous in the world of TeX for his work on
typesetting several languages (like Greek and Hebrew) with TeX. He donated a
series of samples. The Hebrew and Syrian fonts are bitmaps, they might not
look perfect in all circumstances.</p>

<p>my contribution is actually nothing special in the world of TeX. I've
used the cd-cover class and the tiling macros from PSTricks to produce
nice looking enclosure for my sample cd. The idea for the cover is
based upon a title page by Imre Reiner.

<p>The interesting point, I think, is the use of ornaments. Ornaments
have accompanied the letters trough the whole history of the book.
Being once *the* typographer's adornment for centuries, ornaments are
nowadays -- where books are made by graphic designers -- almost
forgotten and replaced with blurred meaningless color spots (quoting
the german typographer H.¬†P.¬†Willberg: "visuelles Hintergrundrauschen"
[visual background noise]); maybe because it's not easy to make
patterns and borders by clicking around with the mouse.

<p>So I think it is a great chance for TeX to bring back ornaments in the
books. There are enough tools to do that in TeX/PostScript/MetaPost
etc. and fortunately there are still many ornamental fonts available.

<p> P.S. I know, there are some articles on tiling with TeX, but they are most
technically oriented. Mine is a real life example.

melts. Forced by a strong electrical field (not shown) the Indium creeps
to the tip of a Tungsten needle and builds a so-called Taylor cone
there. From the tip of the cone Indium ions are extracted by the same
field. --- After some operational time the In reservoir gets empty.

I do genealogy as a hobby, and I have kept the results of my work in
book format almost from the beginning. I used Word for the Mac
originally, but maintaining the document through the constant updates
resulting from new information was not easy. I wanted something a
little more automatic. This was accomplished using a database (4D) to
keep the basic information (names, dates, and family groupings),
individual text files for the narratives about each individual, and
then having the database generate a LaTeX file, which TeX would
process and put together in book form, generating a TOC and an index
in the usual manner.

<p>There is not much fancy TeX code involved, but the result seems to
impress even experienced amateurs who have looked at it. It seemed to
me that this might be interesing because it is an application which is
a bit far afield from the usual disciplines where TeX has taken hold.

by Indiktos (May 2003). Theophanês is a new author and good friend of ours. He
has commissioned the Atelier Fluxus Virus to design the font used in this
sample, out of the <i>Complete Works of Aristotle</i> edited by Bekker in
Leipzig, in the early 19th century. We have called this font <i>Bekkeriana</i>
in honour of Bekker, and all of Theophanês' works will be published in it.
This requires a lot of courage, because in contemporary Greece---contrarily to
Europe---there is great reluctance against typefaces older than 50-70 years.
We hope that this editorial attempt will bring the Greek public of readers
closer to their national typographical heritage, and not only for facsilimiles
or simulations of historical typography, but also for modern texts, as is this
one.

font used in the text is a very special Greek font, designed by Atelier Fluxus
Virus out of hot lead types. It is called <i>dekaexaria</i>, which means "16
points", and is a hot lead typeface which has never been adapted to Linotype
or Monotype machines and has been used very frequently in chapter titles or
cover pages, and for entire books in bibliophilic collections. It is an
extremely vivid font and has very special accents and kernings. It is one of
these fonts where each individual glyph looks badly drawn, but the global
image of text looks very appealing. There is only one hic: it has nothing to
do with Bodoni, and is rather historically connected to the Didot school.

<p>If you want to contribute something that is not already there, or which is
better than what is already there, please send me a submission by e-mail. Do
not send me URLs or anything that requires work for me to find it or download
it, I must set a limit somewhere and I will generally not include items I have
to go browsing for. Sorry.

<p>Include the case and make sure it looks good on screen as well as in print
(so no bitmap fonts), and if possible some source and a description.  If you
want, add a JPG or TIFF of 150x200 (width x length) pixels just like the icons
above. Preferably, keep your names in sync: foo.pdf for the showcase entry
with foo.jpg for the icon. Include source. It does not need to be complete in
that it can be compiled and that all necessary support files are there, but it
should illustrate how it was done in TeX (or MetaPost or whatever).
