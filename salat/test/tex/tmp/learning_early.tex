\dropcap{A} common \myemph{prejudice} states that the fruition of Art is just for a
select few. It is my experience that this is one of the many \myemph{lies} that
hinder the enjoyment of Art in our society. Perhaps it is one of the
lies that some have a vested interest in perpetuating. Why? You
ask. Because Art accesses our \myemph{inner core} and takes us to new levels of
understanding of ourselves and of what surrounds us. Armed with this
\myemph{understanding} we can make better decisions, and gain considerable
distance from the so-called public opinion. \myemph{The crowd is
  untruth}, wrote Kierkegaard.

Another holy lie concerning Art is that we search for things in
it. New things, that are there on the shelf, that anyone can pick and
use, like a soap or toothpaste. We cannot get anything out of Art that
isn't already inside ourselves. 
\myemph{We cannot get} \myemph{more out of things than
we already know.} What Art does is bringing those hidden facets of ours
to daylight. And that reflects in our daily life, in ways that we
cannot anticipate.

During the last 300 years man has \myemph{lost} contact with his \myemph{essence} in a way
like never happened before. Most of the ideals that still impregnate
our society are a product of this \myemph{twilight} of the human. On the other
and, we have the privilege to live in an age where there are
conditions like never existed in the last 300 years to \myemph{re-establish}
this link with our essence. It won't give us the everlasting bliss
that some propagate, so that we can live happily ever after. True
happiness is only achieved through \myemph{accomplishment}. And for
accomplishing we need strife. Only what is dead can live happily ever
after. As human beings we need the chaos that surrounds us to feel
\myemph{alive}. The link with our essence opens up doors to things undreamt:
to a kaleidoscope of new experiences. There are many \myemph{wonderful} things
out there waiting for us. Is up to us to claim them.

What I propose here is one step in the never ending journey of the
pursuit of \myemph{humanness}. The issues that afflict us today are essentially
the same since time immemorial.  Through our conversation with \myemph{Art} we
can, if not solve, at least gain a deeper understanding of these
issues.

Here the vehicle for this conversation is \myemph{music}: Early Music. What is
Early Music? The dictionary definition says that is music composed
until 1750. Like most definitions the focus is on irrelevant
details. What distinguishes Early Music from its Romantic successor is
one thing above all: \myemph{depth}.

Our time is in many ways closer to the pre-romantic age than to the
romantic. The Romantic ideals are dead. We have an inquisitiveness and
a demand for \myemph{clarity} that is incompatible with romantic
mystifications.

When the harbingers of doomsday shout with all their lungs the we have
lost ``our \myemph{ideals}'', they are correct. We no longer hold the romantic
ideals as truths., and therefore we have lost \emph{their} values ---we
are establishing our \myemph{own}. It is always like this, the old must
exit so that the new can enter.

\longpage

This writing takes us in a first tour through Early Music. From the
Middle Age to the Baroque. In the future we will travel down the path
of contemporary ---and even of some romantic--- music. One of the many clues
that tell us that Early Music is \myemph{close} to our age is the fact of many
contemporary composers using Early Music as a \myemph{source} for ideas.
Producing Art in the 21st century that borrows heavily from yore.

Perhaps the biggest clue is that Early Music appeared in the second
half of the 20th century. It has been gaining wider
\myemph{acceptance} ever since. For the younger generations, mostly at odds
with Romanticism, Early and contemporary music are the most \myemph{cherished}.

% Middle age text
\longpage

\dropcap{T}he Middle age spans more than 1000 years. During those 1000 years
music goes from being completely dependent on oral tradition to using
the most \myemph{elaborated} notation that existed so far. 

In current language the references to the Middle Ages are \myemph{synonymous}
of mental darkness and barbaric behaviour. This prejudices are not
our own, but merely echoes from the Renaissance, then trying to
claim its place as an era of unprecedented magnificence, opposed to
the supposedly \myemph{barbaric} age that went before. Our distance from both
these epochs allow us to see things as they truly are, instead of
adhering blindly to this \myemph{shibboleth}. In history there are no clear cut
divisions between epochs. Everything is interconnected: the 
Renaissance sprang from the Gothic, in a continuous flow.

The Middle Age has \myemph{everything} in it. We must evaluate an epoch by its
totality, not by exaggerating one single aspect.

The Middle Age is not much different from any other epoch: cruelty and
carnage coexists with a refined \myemph{culture} and its expression in
Art. Human experience is a string taut between these extremes.

We will have many opportunities to return to the Middle Age and its
Art. The \mylinki{track:credo}{piece} that I've selected for illustrating Medieval Music is
from the late 14th century, 1375--1410: the \myemph{autumn} of the Middle
Age. It is an example of the most refined music that the medieval man
produced.

This is a music full of subtle allegories, it sheds light on the
secular and spiritual life of the author and his time. This is a time
when both philosophy and artistic invention concur for an \myemph{emancipation}
of liturgical music from a strict religious meaning. This piece is an
example of a liturgical parody: that consists in re-elaborating a
secular piece for a ceremonial setting.

The secular pieces are ballads, rondeaus and madrigals, where the
theme is chiefly sublimated \myemph{love} and the suffering that ensues.

Each piece is a syllabus of human existence: grief, joy, pain,
love. The sublime is achieved through the interplay between religious
feeling and the allegorical references to the love of the ladies whose
name is apostrophised in each ballad. The delicate balance between
these elusive \myemph{parables}, and the rhetorical clarity of the theological
argument makes this music unique, \myemph{moving} unlike any other.

Listening to the music and following the text being sung, you perceive
the \myemph{mood} behind each sentence, behind each word, behind each
consonant, behind each vowel. It leaves no one indifferent.

% Renaissance text
\dropcap{I}n the Renaissance the conception of \myemph{love}, is no longer the
sublimated love of the Middle Age, with its hermetic sexual
references, but a lavishly \myemph{sensual} love. This explosion of sensuality
draws inspiration  from classical antiquity. Its roots are in the
14th century, when the influence of the \myemph{Church} in all spheres of
human activity began to \myemph{recede}. It fully blossoms in the 15th century,
to start decaying after the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.

A search of \myemph{simplicity} in Art characterizes the Renaissance. There is
simultaneously a fully developed sensuality and a certain \myemph{curtness}.
On one hand Art excites the senses, on the other hand there is a
self-imposed \myemph{restraint} that places Art beyond the merely
sensual. There is also a greater osmosis between \myemph{popular} and learned
culture.

\newpage

The \mylinki{mp3:dona}{song} that I've chosen to illustrate this period is such an
example. It could be \myemph{heard} both at the court of Philip the II
of Spain (1527--1598) or in a \myemph{tavern} somewhere in Europe or
in the New World. It is a song from the period that the spaniards call
the \emph{Siglo de Oro} ---the Golden Century. It spans from the reconquest
of Granada to the Moors (1492) to the death of Philip the II. During
that period Spain affirmed itself as one of the most powerful nations
in the world. This music has specific \myemph{Iberian} characteristics
like the use of the \mylinki{lo:vihuela}{vihuela} and the percussion,
the later is an upshot of the exchanges between both shores of the
\myemph{Mediterranean}.

% Baroque text

\dropcap{C}hronologies locate the Baroque betwen 1600 and 1750. The Baroque was
the \myemph{reply} to the artistic empoverishment that the Counter-Reformation
promoted. It is mainly characterized by two opposed tendencies: a
growing \myemph{idealism} ---mostly drawing its inspirations from classical
antiquity--- on one hand, and a growing \myemph{realism} on the other. The
modern idea of state started to take shape in the 17th century. Art
began to symbolize not only the taste and inner life of the nobility,
but also served as a statement of the rulers \myemph{magnificence}.

\myemph{Voluptuousness} and a certain excitation of the senses are marked
characteristics of Baroque Art. The Baroque flourishes during the 17th
century and first half of the 18th, when it begins to \myemph{spoil}. It is
during the 17th century that the theory of human affects (\mylinki{lo:affetti}{affetti}) is
developed and transposed to music. Music represents all the range of
human \myemph{emotions}.


In Baroque Opera each character experiences all emotions from grief to
joy, from tears to laughter. Music becomes much more theatrical. It is
the springtime of Opera, reaching increasingly \myemph{vaster} audiences.

The \mylinki{mp3:marche}{piece} that illustrates the Baroque is a
perfect example of this tendency. It is a sort of
\mylinki{lo:buffo}{intermezzo buffo} in a comedy ballet: \emph{Le
 Bourgeois Gentilhomme} (The Bourgeois Gentleman).

The plot revolves around the \myemph{aspirations} of a bourgeois to nobility.
It is a critique of the arrivism of the bourgeoisie against the
tradition of the nobility. Monsieur Jourdain (Mister Jourdain)
yearnings for a \myemph{noble} title are as strong as his discourteous manners.
Count Durante is a character that plays the part of a noble that
although has tradition, lacks the economical power of the ascending
\myemph{bourgeois}. Durante takes advantage of the generous M. Jourdain (M. =
Mr.) to replenish is otherwise meager purse. As any diligent father,
craving for social promotion, M. Jourdain plans to marry his daughter
Lucille to a well born gentleman. But Lucille is enamorated of
Cléonte, a young bourgeois. M. Jourdain is very much opposed to this
matching, refusing to concede his daughter hand to Cléonte. It is then
that they engender a plan to take advantage of M. Jourdain's blind
ambition. A great and noble \myemph{turk} ---a Mufti--- is about to visit the
household of M. Jourdain to request Lucille's hand for his son. The
Mufti's son is none other than Cléonte disguised. For the occasion the
Mufti is willing to nobilitate M. Jourdain with the noble title of
Mamamouchi, thus answering to M. Jourdain desire of nobility.

In an \myemph{hilarious} scene bordering on cruelty, and spoken in
\mylinki{lo:sabir}{sabir}, M. Jourdain is nobilitated by enduring an ordeal that
ends with being battered with a stick. All ends well though.

This play is an example of the french comedy-ballet: a play
\myemph{interspersed} with the music and dance. The turkish ceremony scene is
such an example. In stage there are not only the actors of the play,
but also the dancers and musicians accentuating the ridiculous of the
\myemph{scene}.

Listening to the music we realize the ridiculous pomp atmosphere, and
the way that the scene unfolds. With the percussions underlining the
\myemph{foolishness} of M. Jourdain. Ending with an avalanche of dissonances to
further stress the ridiculous.

The theme of the play was suggested to \mylinki{lo:moliere}{Molière}
by the king of France: \mylinki{lo:louis}{Louis \Romannum{14}}
(1638--1715). It was to serve the purpose of cleansing the humiliation
that His Majesty had suffered by virtue of the unpoliteness of the
ambassador that the turkish emperor had sent to France in 1669. The
play was premiered at the Chateâu de Chambord in 1670, in a
performance for the court.

 During Louis \Romannum{14} reign, music was pivotal in establishing
 \myemph{french style} throughout Europe. The king lavishly dispensed
 money to setup elaborated spectacles to impress the nobility and
 foreign dignitaries that attended the performances, thus
 unequivocally affirming his power.

The composer that more contributed to this display of royal
magnificence was \mylinki{lo:lully}{Jean-Baptiste Lully}. 

\newpage

Lully's music has two pillars: \myemph{strength} and \myemph{rigor}. Strength in the
sense of power, energy, something telluric. Rigor in the sense of
self-imposed control, of not letting oneself go: a command of raw
force. These are the ideals of french nobility during Louis' \Romannum{14}
reign.

Dance is specially considered during Louis reign. It is an expression
of the human spirit: \myemph{gracefulness} and rigor, and at the same time an
excellent physical exercise. The king founds in 1666 the Royal Academy
of Dance; in the founding letter it is written:

\newpage
This recording gives us a glimpse of a world where the \myemph{ideals} of the
Middle Age and the Renaissance coexisted. A period that spans less
than 50 years, from 1370 onward. The artists of this time were both
proud heirs of the Medieval tradition and resolute advocates of the
new  \myemph{humanistic} thinking. 

The music of this epoch is among the most elaborated that mankind ever
produced, of written Western music that is.

The composers were members of the same intelectual circles as
Francesco Petrarca or Geoffrey Chaucer. They were conscious of the
brevity of the moment that they lived and of its exceptional
character. This lead them to \myemph{experiment} a multitude of artifices that
rendered their music more subtle, more touching, more emotive: more
\myemph{human}.

It is music composed at the francophile courts of northern Italy. In
particular at the court of the Viscontis ---the dukes of Milan--- during
the reign of \mylinki{lo:gian}{Gian Galeazzo Visconti}. Gian Galeazzo's ruthlessness
regarding the affairs of the state was matched only by his deep
\myemph{appreciation} of Art. He always sought to secure a rich intelectual
atmosphere in his court. His library, which a substantial part came
from war looting, was among the best of Europe. Poets, philosophers,
theologians, musicians, all converged to his castle at Pavia. The
meetings held at Gian Galeazzo's library, where lively discussions
between the \myemph{finest} spirits of the time shaped things to come, and
specially the music that we listen in this recording.

It is not surprising that this music has a \myemph{richness} that is difficult
to match by any other in the history of the Western world. As far as I
know, this is the first recording that attempts to give us back this
music with all its richness. Mala Punica has made the music of this
period its province, and with \myemph{outstanding} results.

The liturgical parody is a form where a secular tune is taken as a basis
for liturgical piece. Usually from the ordinary of the \mylinki{lo:mass}{Mass}.

A striking example of that is the Gloria \emph{En Attendant} by
\mylinki{lo:matteo}{Matteo da Perugia}. It is based on a \myemph{ballad} by Filippo da Caserta:
\emph{En Attendant}, that was dedicated to \mylinki{lo:bernabo}{Bernabò Visconti}, uncle of
Gian Galeazzo, that was arrested and poisoned under his orders.
Bernabò's motto was \emph{Souffrir m'estuet} ---Suffer, I
must. It is a display of strength, and an \myemph{exaltation} of life. If we
are here, we must suffer, and that means being alive, otherwise we are
dead. 

The ballad has a verse \emph{En attendant souffrit m'estuet grief
  payne} ---While waiting I must suffer grievous pain--- that celebrates
the nobility of Bernabò. Being at the same time a plaint and an
\myemph{affirmation} of his dignity: how he stoically endured his captivity
while awaiting the visit of death. Although the tone of the Gloria is
mostly plaintive, it ends with an affirmative Amen, with the choir
underlining the \myemph{hopeful} tone. This was a time when the great schism of
the West ---the coexistence of two popes, one in Rome and the other in
Avignon--- divided Christendom. The plaintive tone is also a request
for the schism to end. Jill Feldman's performance is perfect, all the
emotional \myemph{nuances} behind each note are masterfully delivered.

The track that I choose to illustrate the Middle Age is the
\mylinki{mp3:credo}{``Credo du Village''} \anch{track:credo} by \mylinki{lo:zac}{Zaccara da Teramo}. It a sort of hypnotic
induction where words and music work together to deepen a trance like
state in the listener. Each \myemph{wave} of words come one after the other in
a rhythmically defined stream. To this flow of words the instruments
are progressively added, layer after layer, until they \myemph{fuse} together
bewitching the listener. It is impossible to escape the \myemph{spell} of this
music, it commands our undivided attention. It testifies Zaccara's
exquisite musicianship.

Other \myemph{remarkable} example of the Art of Matteo is the \emph{false}
Agnus Dei. It is a polytextual piece where two texts are sung
simultaneously. A Agnus Dei and a Ave Sancta Salus Mundi are sung by
different choirs at the beginning, but during the performance the
roles of choirs alternate, like which text takes the lead. Both texts
are perfectly understable. They \myemph{illuminate} each other ---polytextuality
is an expressive device.

Perhaps some \myemph{subtle} details it will escape you at first listening. But
as you continue to listen those details will become more and more
evident. The subtle prolongation and changes of notes by the singers
contributes to the \myemph{expressive} force of this music. The Agnus Dei is
linked with the Benedicamus Domino through an ingenious arrangement of
medieval dances, where the melodies of two dances are used to make the
transition from one piece to the other: it is at the same time smooth
and \myemph{dissonant}.

The 20th century scholars studying this music, impressed with its
superb \myemph{craftsmanship} named it \mylinki{lo:ars}{Ars Subtilior}: the Most Subtle
Art. So as to distinguish it from the music of the 14th century that
preceded.

This is an \myemph{outstanding recording} and makes a good start for the
appreciation of \myemph{Medieval music}.

Spanish music of the 16th century reflects the
\myemph{exceptional} character of the moment that Spain, as a nation,
was living. It is a music where both the usual themes of the
Renaissance are present ---namely \myemph{love}--- and specific
spanish themes, like national pride.  In this recording we have
several opportunities to savour this \myemph{duality}. Such an example
is the song \emph{Qu'es de ti, desconsolado}, that speaks of the recent
conquest of Granada to the Moors (1492).

The word plays a central role in this music. songs like \emph{Al Alva
  Venid} ---Come at Dawn---, track \# 1, where the intelligibility of the
text is of the utmost importance.

This is a recording that gives us a taste of secular music in Spain in
the 16th century. The \myemph{performance is superb}. All the southern
European characteristics are present: \myemph{joy, the absence of
  unrestlessness, melancholy, lightness, a certain curtness}. It is a

This film/soundtrack gives us a glimpse of the world of king Louis the
\Romannum{14} and his age. A glimpse of the \myemph{summit} of the French
Baroque. Music takes center stage in this film, like it took in the
days of Louis' reign. Is also shows the \myemph{ascension} and fall of the
composer Jean-Baptiste Lully, and his later abandoned companion de
route: the playwriter-actor \mylinki{lo:moliere}{Molière}. All the film revolves around this
triad: the king, the composer and the playwriter.

The recreation of the era is magnificent, with carefully chosen
costumes, sets, and above all a cinematography that captures 
exquisitely the \myemph{flickering} ambiance of candlelight.

All Art was to serve the king, the state, God. Music should \myemph{resonate}
with the established order, it should make clear who is in charge and
why it is so. Lully created a new style of music for a new era. An era
of light: \emph{le Roi Soleil} ---the Sun King.

This new style of music soon spread to other countries in
Europe. Admired and copied.

The film accurately depicts the part that dance played in the french
society of the 17th century.

The soundtrack performed by Musica Antiqua Köln, directed by Reinhard
Goebel, reproduces all the \myemph{strength} that this music has. For instance,
in the scene of \emph{Le ballet de la nuit}, where a young Louis displays is immense pride, by making his enemies kneel at
his command. The scene overflows with strength, with virility, and
simultaneously with the gracefulness and \myemph{sensuality} of the
dancing. In the film, close up plans of Louis' feet are interspersed
with panoramics and circular travelings showing all the scene.

Equally present is the blossoming of French Opera. From the plays with
musical interludes, like \emph{Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme}, till the
later \emph{Tragédies Lyriques}.

In the CD, track \# 22, \emph{Le Prélude de la Nuit} ---The Prelude of
the Night--- depicts wonderfully the torpor that precedes sleep, it
transmit us a sensation of \myemph{peace} and abandon. When the sun goes to
rest and darkness falls across the sky. This could be allegorically
interpreted: the sun is the king, and without him torpor befalls 
---inaction and immobility--- with \myemph{decline} soon to follow.

The DVD and the soundtrack CD are an excellent way to get to know the
French Baroque ---a quite \myemph{unexplored} land if compared with the Italian
or German Baroque.

For someone entering the Baroque for the first time it is an opportunity
to venture into this wondrous territory by a less traveled path. A
path that makes the journey \myemph{unforgettable}, with many nuggets
just waiting to be found.

   in music--- must employ rhetorical means to move the
   listener. Proceeding from this rhetorical terminology, the
   theoreticians of music from the end of 16th, but specially during
   the 17th and 18th centuries, borrowed the terms as well as
   many other analogies between rhetoric and music. The affects (il
   afetti) are emotional states or rationalized passions. After 1600
   the composers sought to express, chiefly in vocal music, the
   affects related with the text being sung: sadness, anger, hate, joy
   love, jealousy. As a consequence this means that during the 17th
   century and the beginning of the 18th most compositions
   ---or in greater works individual sections--- had a ruling affect.

   As a rule, composers sought to achieve a rational unity that was
   imposed in all elements of the work by its dominant
   affect. Nevertheless, there is not a grand theory of the affects in
   the Baroque, but rather a multitude. Starting with Mersenne and
   Kircher in the middle 17th century, and proceeding with
   Werckmeister, Printz, Mattheson, Marpurg, Scheibe and Quantz that
   devoted substancial parts of their treatises to a classification of
   the affects and its connotations with certain scales, dances,
   rhythms, instruments, forms and styles.

  \begin{explain}{\myemph{Ars Subtilior}}
    \anch{lo:ars}
    A term adapted from the latin \emph{artem magis subtilier} ---most
    subtle art--- that appears in the treatise \emph{Tractatus de
      diversis figuris} attributed to Philipoctus de Caserta
(Filippo da Caserta).

    The term designates works rich in artifices, surely intellectuals,
    but also of extreme sensitivity and profound beauty. This refined
    style covers the the musical activity of the late \Romannum{14}th
    century, chiefly in the meridional courts of Avignon, Orthez,
    Barcelona, in Aragon, in Savoy, in Lombardy, and in the kingdom of
    Cyprus.

    In the Middle Age the term \emph{subtilitas} is used for
    describing the particulars of a work exacerbated in multiple
    qualities like the technical knowhow and the mastership of style.
    It is \emph{subtle} that which is rich in artifices and
    technically perfect. This subtleness is noticed manly in the
    texts, where symbolism, quotations and ambiguity compete in a
    display of artifice and manner.

    The Ars Subtilior presents itself as an attempt to enlarge the
    musical grammar, stimulated by the theoretical activity of the
    aftermath of the Ars Nova.

    If polyphonic treatment is pretty much the same, in the rhythmical
    domain the changes are substantial: with the creation of
    elaborated rhythmic patterns, something that above all
    characterizes the Ars Subtilior.

    It is a transitional style, where a lot of experiments are made,
    some of these will be adopted by the 15th century, other will be
    abandoned.

    \shortpage

    The Ars Subtilior poses serious problems in terms of expressiveness
    and its aesthetic limits. Each work is like a novel, where the plot is
    the polyphonic treatment and the degree of autonomy that each voice
    has contributes to medieval speculation about the existence of
    something middleground between apparence and substance.

\anch{lo:louis}
\begin{explain}{\myemph{Louis \Romannum{14}} (1638--1715)}
King of France between 1643 and 1715, son of Louis XIII and Anne of Austria: Art
patron, instrumentalist and dancer. He grew
up amidst political convulsions, overseen by his mother and Cardinal
Jules Mazarin (1643--1661). During his minority he was forced to flee
Paris three times, due to temporary setbacks to the royal power
orchestrated by the lesser nobility and the Princes of the
Blood. Something that undoubtedly contribute for his distaste of Paris,
and that was partly responsible for the edification of Versailles.

Absolutism was the cornerstone of his reign, as the motto "L'état,
c'est moi" ---The state, it is I--- so unequivocally exemplifies.  He
excluded all ambitious aristocracy from high office in his
government. In 1660 he married the spanish Infanta, Maria Teresa
(daughter of Philip IV), by whom he had six children. Only the dauphin
survived. Louis secretly married Madame de Maintenon, the former
governess of his bastard children in 1683. As a king he not only
consolidated his power in France, but also made France the leading
European nation during the late 17th century.

During his reign French culture became greatly admired and imitated
throughout all of Europe. He was an excelent dancer and took center
stage in the many \emph{ballets de cour} performed at his palaces and
chateâux between 1650 and 1670; he played the guitar and was
particularly fond of performances of keyboard music. He surrounded
himself with notable musicians, both foreign and French. Among these
Lully became his favourite, with the fortune and privileges that
ensue. Music was a cornerstone of the established order, with the king
at the apex. The prestige of the state was rooted in French Art, it
also made unequivocally clear to the members of the aristocracy who
was in charge and dissuaded any hypothetical upheaval. 

\longpage

The king established academies in all branches of the arts
---including music (1669) and dance (1661). He made sure that in all
these areas, and specially music, a specifically French form is
created. Such an example is the tragédie lyrique ---the French form of
opera par excellence. Music was omnipresent in court life. All royal
ceremonies were accompanied by music, from the most mundane to the
most solemn.  The musical establishment of the court grew immensely so
as to fulfill the new royal musical needs.  With Lully at the baton,
the standards of French music rised. Precision was one very important
aspect.  Something which allegedly distinguished French music from the
Italian music that dominated the court before Louis \Romannum{14}
reign.

In religious music the grand motet, is a genre instituted by the king,
and that symbolizes his overseeing of religious matters. Lully made
significative contributions to this genre.

This cultural display of power is companion to the series of
aggressive wars that he conducted throughout all of Europe.

\figlegend{Jean-Baptiste Lully}

\anch{lo:lully}

\begin{explain}{\myemph{Jean-Baptiste Lully} (1632--1687)} 
[born Giovanni Battista]
Born in Florence, Lully become \emph{garçon de chambre} to Mlle. de
Montpensier in 1646. He spent six years at her service at the
Tuileries palace, during which time he learned to master several
instruments, including the violin and the harpsichord, and studied
composition with Nicolas Métru. As a member of a noble household he
was granted entrance to \emph{divertissements}, balls and other court
spectacles, where he learnt the popular french dances and heard for
the first time, the Vingt-quatre violons du Roi and recitals with the
finest singers of the epoch. 

His ascension starts in 1653. Already an acquaintance of the young
Louis \Romannum{14} as a dancer. In February of that same year they both danced
in the \emph{Ballet de la nuit}, with music composed by Lully. He succeeded
the Italian violinist Lazzarini as the composer of the king's
instrumental music ---compositeur de la musique instrumentale du
roi. His main function was that of composing music for the \emph{ballets de
cour} ---court ballets. The music he composed was much appreciated, his
ballet \emph{intermédes} were so successful that they dominated the operas
in which they featured. An example of that is the relative
indifference with which Cavali's opera \emph{Ercole Amante} was received,
as opposed to the dancing intermédes that Lully composed, by the
occasion of the royal wedding of Louis \Romannum{14} and Maria Teresa the
Infanta of Spain (1660).

Was he not only a remarkable musician and dancer, but also a gifted
comedian. Lully joined with Molière to produce several
\emph{comédie-ballets}, that were performed at the royal palaces,
chateâux and in Paris, beginning with \emph{Le mariage forcé} (1664)
and ending with \emph{Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme} (1670). Lully's
intermédes were like small operas interspersed in Molière's satirical
plays. Gradually these intermédes became prominent, and relegated the
plays that they adorned to a secondary role.

To this adherence to his music, wasn't strange the eulogic tone
towards the royal person that characterized his ballets. With the king
usually playing the part of a God that with zeal took care of the
Universe and was indispensable for its functioning. Whereas Molière's
plays with its bitter satire sometimes made ``dangerous'' forays into
royal matters.

The favour of the king was fundamental in backing Lully for his
acquisition in 1672 of the \emph{académies d'ópera} which had severe
financial problems unsoluble for the then director Pierre Perrin.
After which a series of royal decrees made Lully the owner of a
monopoly regarding the use of music in stage productions. Molière was
the first to suffer with the newly imposed restrictions. And after his
death Lully bought his theatre and took control of his troupe ---the
future Comédie Française.

The collaboration of Lully with Phillipe Quinault in the production of
grandiose \emph{tragédies lyriques} was already established by that
time. The machinist and architect Carlo Vigarani, and the mâitre de
danse Pierre de Beauchamp, completed the production team.

\longpage

The king furnished Lully funds to turn Molière's theatre into the
Académie Royale de Musique. From 1673 until his death a opera was
produced by Lully and Quinault every year at the Académie. Their
working methods were autocratic, Lully oversaw all aspects of the
Académie with an iron hand. 

Lully was also a shrewd businessman, and the Académie was a profitable
business. The money earned was wisely invested by Lully in diverse
goods.

By 1681, he was granted a title of nobility by the king, that also
appointed him for the much coveted office of \emph{secrétaire du roi}
---the king's secretary.

He sensed very well the taste of the times and always followed it
closely, thus changing the style of his operas as necessary. After his
third opera \emph{Thésée} (1675), comical scenes were abolished. He sought to
create a specific French form of opera where the spoken word has a
central role: the declamation of the text took precedence over all
other considerations. A substantial distinction from Italian opera,
which the king wanted to eradicate from french stages. 

The tragédies lyriques were allegories where the royal person was
always lauded, and all deviance from the established order was
represented as a calamity to be avoided at all cost. Preceding each
opera was a prologue which commented on events of the kingdom, always
in a royally eulogic manner.

Lully demanded the utmost precision of his musicians, as well as the
capacity to instill vigor and strength to their playing. The same was
demanded of the singers and choirs. He and Quinault produced grand
spectacles with exhilarating moments, such as military battles, and
dramatically powerful moments as the monologues of Atys (1676) and
Armide (1686). These spectacles demanded great sums of money that the
king always approved off. They were admired and envied throughout all
Europe, with some monarchs trying to emulate the ambiance of
Versailles with spectacles performed at their court.
\longpage 

The fact of being an Italian the "father" of french music was resented
in many quarters, and Lully's figure was the object of bitter satire,
with more or less obvious innuendos about his bisexuality. Also the
stronghold he maintained in french music and drama was a further motive
for being hated by those suffering under these restrictions.  In those
days only one opera per year was offered to the Parisian public: the
one that Lully and Quinault produced.

\longpage

He sought to extend his dominating influence to church music
also. Barring the path to the royal heart to musicians as outstanding
as Charpentier, that was refused as \emph{sous-mâitre} de La Chapelle Royale
by Lully's decision. Hence eliminating any hypothetic competition as
the most favoured musician of the royal court.

Early 1687, when conducting a Te Deum, he injured himself fatally in a
foot with the baton. Refusing the amputation of his leg, he died of
gangrene some days later. The scene that opens the film \emph{Le
Roi Danse} reconstitutes this event.

\begin{explain}{\myemph{Mass}} [Missa]
\anch{lo:mass}
  The Mass, originally the main rite for baptized christians, quite
  early took the form of a official and community festive
  celebration. The medieval societies made it the core of all
  sociability, for it was seen as an occasion for a periodical assembly
  where all members of human communities in the West converged. It was
  also a lieu of exchanges between the terrestrial and celestial
  worlds. The Mass represents the renewal of the \emph{sacrifice} of
  Christ.

%  \newpage

  The Mass of latin Christianity, or its equivalent in the Orthodox
  and Byzantine Church, has its origin in Christ last supper with His
  disciples, described in the Gospels. The office is the renewal of
  the sacrifice of Jesus for the redemption of sinful mankind, by
  association of the faithful to the communion of bread and wine
  transformed in the blood and flesh of Christ. The eucharistic rite
  represents the most extraordinary condensed of the exchanges between
  the celestial and terrestrial world. This rite is at the heart of
  medieval practices in the West until the reforms in the early 16th
  century ---surviving, albeit in a changed way--- in roman catholicism.

  The Mass is divided in two parts: the catechumens Mass and the
  faithful Mass. The first is open to all, baptized or non baptized,
  jewish and christians. It is in the first part that after a prayer
  enunciated by the deacon the assembly replies \emph{Kyrie Eleison} 
  ---God have mercy of us.

  \longpage

  The faithful Mass is reserved only to baptized christians, where after
  the offertory the \emph{Credo} is sung. The cerimonies of this part
  are important, the priest prepares the matter of the sacrifice (bread
  and wine), afterwards offerring it to the altar. Following the
  offertory the priest says the eucharistic prayer, at the end of which
  the \emph{Agnus Dei} is chanted.



  After the XIIth century the Mass has two basic forms: the
  \emph{Ordinary} and the \emph{Proper} of the Mass. 

  The pieces that compose the Ordinary are common to all latin
  Churches; its realization in music may vary between churches. Its
  parts are: \emph{Kyrie}, \emph{Gloria}, \emph{Credo},
  \emph{Sanctus}, \emph{Agnus Dei}, sometimes followed by a
  thanksgiving chant the \emph{Benedicamus Domino}.

  The Proper in divived in \emph{sanctoral} ---or proper of saints---
  ideally following the order of the calendar of saints, or \emph{temporal} 
  ---or proper of the time, following the order of the life of
  Christ. The pieces of the Proper allow to identify the origin of a
  lithurgical manuscript, because they reveal the local
  particularities. It is composed by \emph{Introit}, \emph{Collect},
  \emph{Epistle}, \emph{Gradual}, \emph{Alleluia}, \emph{Gospel},
  \emph{Offertory}, \emph{Secret}, \emph{Preface}, \emph{Communion}
  and \emph{Post-communion}.

\begin{explain}{\myemph{Matteo da Perugia} (d. 1418)} [Mattheus de Perusio]
\anch{lo:matteo}
  Italian composer from the beginning of the \Romannum{15}th century, deceased
  problably in the first days of January 1418. Very little is known of his
  life.

\shortpage

  Surely, a native from Perugia, he seems to have made most of his
  career at the service of Pietro Filargos Candia (1340-1410),
  archbishop of Milan since 1402 and promoted to cardinal in
  1405. Pietro had studied in Paris, before teaching theology at the
  Sorbonne; he was an enthusiastic francophile, something which
  in part explains the predominance of french style in Matteo's music.

  In 1406, Matteo accompanies Pietro to Pistoia and Bologne, to be
  elected anti-pope: Alexander V. He remains in Milan to the service
  of Pietro's successor, John XXIII, returning to Milan after the
  deposition of the later in 1414. Matteo becomes then the first
  \emph{magister capell\ae} ---chapel master--- of the Milan Cathedral,
  by the time still under construction.

  Matteo bequeathed us a significant number of works, all contained in
  the Modena manuscript, which presumably was written under his
  guidance. His works are both religious and profanes. He is a
  composer midway between the italian and french tradition, employing
  techniques from both. His music crosses not only geographical
  borders, but also temporal borders: some works are written in a style
  reminiscent of the \Romannum{14}th century; other incorporate the stylistic
  innovations of the 15th century, such as the greater attention given
  to the intelligibility of the text being sung, and a more harmonic
  conception of the polyphonic texture.

\begin{explain}{\myemph{Molière} (1622--1673)} [Jean-Baptiste
  Poquelin]\\
Baptised the 15th of January at the Saint-Eustache church in Paris,
quite probably born one or two days before. Son of Jean Poquelin and
Marie Cressé. Both from weaver families, they live at les Halles
quarter.

His mother dies in 1632, at the age of 30. The inventory of her
possessions reveals a woman of taste, with fine furnitures, jewels, and
a judicious library. His father marries the year after with Catherine
Fleurette, daughter of a merchant, that will give him three daughters.
Catherine dies in 1636, from both matrimonies five children remain,
with Jean-Baptiste being the eldest.

In 1635 Jean-Baptiste enters the jesuit school of Clérmont. There
having as colleague the Prince of Conti, that later will be his
patron.

Studies law at Orléans in 1640, obtains his practising license and
enrolls at the Bar as a lawyer. He practices law during a few months,
it is then that he starts to attend the theatrical milieu, presumably
serving as compère to one stage producer. 

He acquired the taste for dramatic poetry during the time of his
studies, and he is not indifferent to the charms of a young and
beautiful comedian: Madeleine Béjart, four years his senior. He falls
in love and she becomes his mistress.

\newpage

In 1643, after settling matters of partage of his mother estate with
his father, and renouncing the apointment of royal weaver that his
father procured for him, he founds a theatrical troupe:
\emph{Le Illustre Théâtre}. A company created around the Béjart family,
notably Madeleine. The troupe opens its first theather in January 1,
1644, in the Saint-German faubourg, in Paris.

The first play signed Molière appears at the 28th of June. He will
never give any explanation regarding his choice of pseudonym.

The beginnings of the company are disappointing, and due to severe
financial difficulties they are obliged to close the theater. However,
in that same day the contract for a new theater in another location, in
the Saint-Paul parish, is signed. But the situation does not improve, and Molière
is twice imprisoned because of debts. Released under bail, the
company must pay the sums that are due to owner of the building where
the theater is housed. Jean-Baptiste's father is forced to intervene
several times to financially support his son. With the surviving
troupe, he decides to leave Paris and join in province the company of
Charles Dufresne patroned by the Duke d'Épernon, governor of
Guyenne. Molière's provincial adventure lasts thirteen years, with tours in
the west and south of France: Nantes, Poitiers, Agen, Toulose, Albi,
Narbonne, \&c.

In 1653 the company is welcomed at Pézenes by the Prince de Conti,
that accords it his protection and his name: troupe of his Royal Grace
the Prince de Conti. During the years 1653--1657 they continue to tour
throughout France, now in the northeast: Carcassone, Pézenes, Avignon,
Grenoble, Vienne, Lyon, Dijon. Molière replaces Dufresne at the head
of the company.

In 1657 the sudden conversion of the Prince de Conti in a devout,
makes him now display his open hostility towards the theater,
withdrawing his patronage.

\longpage

In 1659 the company regains Paris, and tastes its first success with
the play \emph{Les Précieuses Ridicules}. After the second
presentation the victory is astounding, coinciding also with the first
plot against Molière, engedered by the competition of the Hotel de
Bourgogne.

In January 1661, the superintendent of the finances gives a great
feast in his château of Vaux-le-Vicomte. Molière in collaborates with
Beauchamp that composes the music and coreographs the ballets.  He
will become the chosen coreographer for all the following
comédies-ballets. They create the first comedy interspersed with music
and dance: \emph{Les Fâcheux}, that is presented before the king, who
suggests that Molière should include in his gallery of characters the
one of a hunting maniac. He very quickly composes the scene that will
appear at the next performance of the play at the Palais Royal, in the
4th of November.

\shortpage

He marries Armande Béjart, aged 20, in 1662. His adversaries spread
the rumour that the matrimony is incestuous, because of his former
relationship with his mother-in-law, Madeleine. The following year his play
\emph{L'École des Femmes} brings him trouble with the religious
authorities and devouts, the same year the king grants him a royal
gratification of 1000 \emph{livres}. 

The year 1664 marks the beginning of Molière's collaboration with
Lully that writes the music for the dancing intermedes of the
comedy-ballet \emph{Le Mariage Forcé}, presented before the queen
mother in her apartment.  

Lully always aware of the prospects his acquaintances could bring him,
quickly cemented the association with Molière, by the time, quite
popular at the court. This was a two-way street, since the inclusion
of dances related with the action, something which the king so much
enjoyed, could only made his plays even more popular.

\longpage

In the beggining drama was paramount, and music secondary. Such is the
case in \emph{Le Mariage Forcé} and \emph{La princese d'Élide},
produced for the outdoor spectacles at Versailles in 1664: \emph{Le
  Plaisirs de l'Ile Enchantée}. As the time
went on, the growing esteem in which the king held Lully made the
roles of music and drama reverse. Lully gradually maneuvered in order
that musical intermessions became the core of the comédie-ballets.
That can be seen in \emph{Les Amants Magnifiques} and \emph{Le
  Bourgeois Gentilhomme} (1670).

Their last joint production was \emph{Psyché} (1671) a \emph{tragédie-ballet}, a
work that became for Lully the draft for the 1678 \emph{tragédie-lyrique} of
the same name, in which he colaborated with Thomas Corneille and
Fontenelle. When his status was assured, Lully droped Molière as an
associate and friend. Taking advantage of his special relationship with
the king, Lully inspired a series of decrees that made life for Molière
increasingly difficult. With severe restraints of the use of music in
stage works. Abandoned by Lully Molière turned to Charpentier. They
revised three of the old comédie-ballets so as to conform with the new
restrictions. After that they collaborated on \emph{Le malade imaginaire}
(1673) ---the title role was played by Molière--- during the fourth
performance he ruptured a blood vessel in a fit of coughing and died.

\anch{lo:vihuela}

  \begin{explain}{\myemph{vihuela}}
    A plucked intrument used in the Iberian Peninsula, approximately
    guitar shaped but strung like a lute with six paired courses and
    normally ten frets. 

    The word \emph{vihuela} was used in Spain from the XIIIth century
    forward to designate a stringed instrument with a flat back. There
    is distinction between the \emph{vihuela de arco} ---bowed vihuela,
    and the \emph{vihuela de peñola} ---plectrum vihuela--- which with
    the development of finger plucking became the \emph{vihuela de
      mano}. Likely the vihuela de arco evolved into the viol at the
    end of the 15th century.

    There is little technical difference between music for the lute
    and for the vihuela, although due to its small body and long neck
    the vihuela can be played in higher positions than the lute, some works
    written for it take advantage of this, like the \emph{Libro de
      Musica para Vihuela intitulado Orphenica lyra} (1554) by the
    blind vihuela virtuoso Miguel de Fuenllana.


    During the reign of emperor Charles V, the vihuela reaches its
    zenith as a favoured instrument of the musical elite. The emperor
    employed mostly flemish musicians in his chapel ---responsible for
    religious music; albeit trusting secular music to native
    musicians. In his private music the vihuela had a proeminent role.
    It continues to be an esteemed instrument in the court of Philip
    II, where in 1556 Miguel de Fuenllana was enroled as a chamber
    musician to Isabel de Valois, the third wife of the king. Towards
    the end of the 16th century the status of the vihuela as a chosen
    instrument is undermined by the increasing popularity of the
    guitar.

whom he was affianced since 1345. At October 11, 1354, his uncle
Giovanni divides the governement of the State by his three nephews Matteo,
Galeazzo II and Bernabò, after having bought from the Holy Roman
Emperor Charles VI from Bohemia the privilege of the imperial
vicariate.

In 1355 Bernabò starts the construction of the citadel of Bergamo, and
attempts to conquer Bologne then ruled by Giovanni Visconti Ollegio, but the
attempt fails. At the 26th of September of the same year his brother Matteo
dies, and the Viscontine state is divided among himself and his
brother Galeazzo II ---the former obtaining the oriental part and in
Milan the Roman, Tonsa, Oriental and Nova doors.

In October 4, 1356 the imperial vicar Markward von Raudeck attacks
Milan due to the offenses perpretated by the Viscontis against the
emperor, November 12, the vicar is made prisioner by the troops of
Bernabò. Starts the fortification of the San Giovanni de Conca palace,
and the embellishment of the homonymous church, where later his
equestrian statue made by Bonino da Campione will be placed. 

In 1359 Bernabò concedes generous funds to several hospitals in the
city. Not even this charitable activity shelters him from the Papal
wrath. When trying to take Bologne, city which Giovanni Visconti da
Ollegio had given to the Pope. In August 1360, the Pope emits a decree
condemning Bernabò, the imperial vicar. His army is defeated by troops
of pontifical legate under the command of Galeotto Malatesta, in June
29, 1361. It is a great disaster, with hundreds of casualties and
prisioners, as well the loss of the army's treasure. Since misfortunes
are always in good company, in October 14, 1362, his son-in-law
Ugolino Gonzaga, husband of Caterina Visconti, is murdered by his
brothers. An event that lays the foundations for the clash between
Mantua and Bernabò. Menaced at several fronts, he dispatches his
ambassadors to the papal court in order to strike a deal ---mediated by
the king of France, Jean II, "the Good"--- regarding Bologne.

Once the date set for Bernabò presenting himself in Avignon expires,
Pope Urban V proclaims Bernabò an heretic, schismatic, and damned of
the Church, depriving him of all his rights. The sentence extends to
his sons. The month after Bernabò suffers a heavy defeat, with his son
Ambroglio made prisioner. The armistice with the pontifical legate
Albernoz remains uncertain, due to the hostility that he
nurtures towards the Visconti. Peace is signed in March 1364, Bernabò
leaves the Bolognese castle in exchange of 500 000 florins.

In the year 1367 Bernabò sets aside his hate for Consignorio della
Scala, meeting with him to decide of an advantageous common strategy:
proposing him an alliance in exchange of support in a campaign against
Mantua. In the spring of 1368 his armies attack Mantua, after several
vicissitudes in the clash with Mantua, an agreement between Bernabò,
the vicar and the imperor is signed in Modena. To this the acquisition
of Reggio, occupied by Feltrino da Gonzaga, by 50 000 florins
follows. The Pope declares a crusade against the Visconti.

At the 28 of March, 1387, under the accusations of heresy and
contumacy Bernabò and his brother Galeazzo II are once more condemned
by the Church. The situation deteriorates in Milan due to an epidemy
of plague that declared itself in the summer: Bernabò decisevely
intervenes, not without cruelty, but notably reducing the damages. In
that same summer his son Ambroglio is murdered near Caprino Bergamasco
during a skirmish with the inhabitants of the valley. In September
Bernabò commands an expedition with the purpose of crushing the
rebellion. The monastery of Pontida, that supported the rebels, is
ravaged to the ground.

In the month of March of 1379, Bernabò divides his dominions among his
five legitimate sons: to Marco half of Milan; to Lodovico Crema and
Lodi; Cremona for Carlo; San Donnino and Parma for Borgo; for Rudolfo
Soncino and Ghiara d'Adda; Mastino gets Brescia and Val Camonica. For
Donnina dei Porri and son Lancilotto goes the feud of Pagazzano in the
Ghiara d'Adda. In that same year a fire occurs in palace of San
Giovanni de Conca, a fact that is interpreted as an omen of Bernabò's
impending doom.

October 12, 1380, Bernabó proposes an alliance against the foreign
companies in Italy. The wedding of his daughter Caterina and Gian
Galeazzo is celebrated at the 12th of October 1380, Gian Galeazzo's
son Azzone dies that same day, Bernabó forgets to present his
condolences to his nephew-son-in-law. 

In February 1382 Bernabó and Ludovico d'Angio meet in Milan to agree
upon the conquest of Naples. The matrimony between Ludovico's son
---Ludovico II--- and Bernabó's daughter Lucia is discussed. The agreement
is signed in July 18 of the following year in Milan.

In May 6, 1385, fearing that the growing power of his uncle places his
life in danger, with a stratagem Gian Galeazzo captures his uncle
together with his cousins Ludovico ---that is also his sister
Violante's husband--- and Rudolfo. After occupying all of Bernabó and
his sons' city domains, under the escort of Gasparino Visconti Bernabó
is transfered from the castle of Porta Giovia to the castle of Trezzo
together with Donnina dei Porri that becomes his wife in prison
---Gian Galeazzo will annul this matrimony afterwards. In 19th of
December Bernabó is murdered with poison placed in a plate of beans.
He will be buried in San Giovanni da Conca with all the hypocritical
honors of state.

Bernabó's death was not mourned due to his ruthless
disposition. Stories about his legendary cruelty abound. The following
few suffice to give you a glimpse of his ferocity.

Although initially destined to a priestly career, Bernabó was strongly
anti-clerical. In one occasion, founding two benedictine monks that
were charged by the Pope Innocent VI of delivering a letter that
condemned him. It is said that Bernabó reached them at the drawbridge
over the Lambro river, he asked them if they wanted to eat or drink.
The question was sarcastic, since the real choice consisted in
being thrown to water and drowned, or eating a repast of parchment and
seals. the very letter that they delivered. They have chosen to eat,
hence they were coerced to swallow a indigest meal of parchment and
pontifical seals.

Another episode involves his illegitimate daughter, that arrested under
the charge of adultery, was first tortured and later mured alive in
the Rochetta di Porta Nuova. She agonized during seven months and
died, then nothing more than a living skeleton. It is said that remorses of
these brutal feats spurred Bernabó to outbursts of charitable actions.

Bernabó was also someone that liked to be encompassed by people with
graceful presence. It so happens that an unfortunate ambassador that
Bernabó deemed to be tiny, thus ugly, was sent in a horse purposely
saddled in such a manner that the stirrups were to low and the poor
man could not reach them so as to impart orders to the horse that
speedily galloped while he desperately tried to deliver his
message to Bernabó, that was very much amused by the scene.

When not involved in warfare and misdeeds he could be found in his
library in earnest reading of Arthurian novels, where he sought ideas
for the many chivalric tournaments that he zealously organized. Hunting
was another one of his passions. He surrounded himself of buffoons
that amused him with their badinage.

\figlegend{Gian Galeazzo Visconti}

\anch{lo:gian}
\begin{explain}{\myemph{Gian Galeazzo Visconti} (1351--1402)}
  Son of Galeazzo II and Bianca di Savoia. Born October 16, 1351.
  Marries the twelve year old Isabelle de Valois in June 1360, thus
  sanctioning the alliance of Galeazzo II with the house of Valois,
  then going through severe economical difficulties by virtue of the
  One Hundred Years War. With this marriage Gian Galeazzo obtains for
  himself the title of count of Vertus. His firstborn, Gian Galeazzo
  II, is believed to be born March 4, 1366. Two years later Azzone is
  born, in the summer of 1370, his daughter Valentina is born and in
  1372 Carlo, whose birth will be the cause of Isabelle's death due to
  childbirth complications in September 11, 1372.

  After his father death in 1378, Gian Galeazzo hastens to get for
  himself the recognition of the imperial vicariate held by Galeazzo
  II. In January 17, 1380, arrives from the Holy Roman Emperor
  Wenceslaus the much coveted diploma that grants him the vicariate.
  His uncle Bernabò slights this formality, a fact that later Gian
  Galeazzo will use to legitimate the arresting of his uncle. At the
  2nd of October Gian Galeazzo marries forcefully his cousin Caterina,
  according to the wishes of his uncle Bernabò, hence giving one more
  reason for the incubation of a rebellion. In 1385 the situation
  rushes to his advantage, and Gian Galeazzo with the support of his
  mother, Bianca di Savoia, orquestrates a coup d'état against his
  uncle-father-in-law Bernabò. In May 6 he knavishly arranges the
  capture of his uncle and sons Ludovico and Rodolfo. Placing them
  under arrest in the castle of Porta Giovia. Gian Galeazzo disposes
  of a small army of 500 lanciers under the orders of Jacopo del
  Verme, Ottone di Mandello and Giovanni Malaspina, with the mission
  of assuaging a hypothetical uprising supporting his uncle and
  cousins.  Instead, the mob sacks the palace of Bernabò and his
  sons, destroying the tributary records. In May 7, the rock from the
  Porta Romana surrenders. The General Counsel of the city grants him
  the seignory of Milan, neglecting Bernabò's heirs. Between the 8th
  of May and the 14th of May Gian Galeazzo occupies all the city of
  Bernabò and his sons.

%\longpage

The year after founds in Milan \emph{il Duomo} ---the Cathedral of Milan---
hiring the best artists then availabe in Europe. From now on Gian
Galeazzo's ambitions will be measuraless: in 1387 obtains the dominion
of Vicenza and Verona, in 1390 Pádua; in May 11, 1395, the emperor
Wenceslaus grants him the title of Duke of Milan, he then tries to
unite all of Italy around his figure. Conquers Pisa, Perugia, Assisi
and Siena. Florence feeling threatened assembles a military alliance
against the Visconti. 

\newpage

In 1396 he founds the Carthusian monastery of La Certosa at Pavia:
supposedly the one for which the music that it is included in the
recording Missa Cantilena was written for.

%\shortpage

On a par with his political ambitions Gian Galeazzo considerably
stimulates Art and Trade in his domains. Attracting to his castle of Pavia
the most illustrious european spirits. Among them  
the poet Francesco Petrarca, that oversaw the collection of the
Visconti Library and exerted great influence over Gian Galeazzo.
He founded also the University of Piacenza and encouraged all
government officials to have a training at the University of Pavia.

His enterprise of the unification of all Italy will never reach a safe
port. Dies victim of the plague in 1402, while preparing a final
assault on Florence, the only obstacle between him and full control of
northern Italy.  Bequeaths a depauperated state, leaving his
widow Caterina in serious difficulties.
