  abstract = {We analyze the {Jaynes-Cummings} model of quantum optics, in the strong-dispersive
	regime. In the bad cavity limit and on timescales short compared
	to the atomic coherence time, the dynamics are those of a nonlinear
	oscillator. A steady-state non-perturbative semiclassical analysis
	exhibits a finite region of bistability delimited by a pair of critical
	points, unlike the usual dispersive bistability from a Kerr nonlinearity.
	This analysis explains our quantum trajectory simulations that show
	qualitative agreement with recent experiments from the field of circuit
	quantum electrodynamics.},

  abstract = {The quantum properties of electromagnetic, mechanical or any other
	type of harmonic oscillator can be revealed by investigating its
	strong coherent coupling to a single quantum two level system in
	an approach known as cavity {QED.} At temperatures much lower than
	the characteristic energy level spacing the observation of vacuum
	Rabi oscillations or mode splittings with one or a few quanta asserts
	the quantum nature of the system. Here, we study how the classical
	response of a quantum cavity {QED} system emerges when its thermal
	occupation -- or effective temperature -- is raised gradually over
	5 orders of magnitude. In this way we explore in detail the continuous
	cross-over from a quantum response to a classical response in the
	spirit of Bohr's correspondence principle. We also demonstrate how
	to extract effective cavity field temperatures from both spectroscopic
	and time-resolved vacuum Rabi measurements.},

	coupling is found to exhibit a coexistence between the quantum photon
	blockaded state and a quasi-coherent bright state. We characterize
	the slow time scales and the basin of attraction of these metastable
	states using full quantum simulations. This form of bistability can
	be useful for implementing a qubit readout scheme that does not require
	additional circuit elements. We propose a coherent control sequence
	that makes use of a simple linear chirp of drive amplitude and frequency
	as well as qubit frequency. By optimizing the parameters of the system
	and the control pulse we demonstrate theoretically very high readout
	fidelities ({\textgreater}98\%) and high contrast, with experimentally
	realistic parameters for qubits implemented in the circuit {QED}
	architecture.},

  journal = nphys,
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Thorough control of quantum measurement is key to the development
	of quantum information technologies. Many measurements are destructive,
	removing more information from the system than they obtain. Quantum
	non-demolition {(QND)} measurements allow repeated measurements that
	give the same eigenvalue. They could be used for several quantum
	information processing tasks such as error correction, preparation
	by measurement, and one-way quantum computing. Achieving {QND} measurements
	of photons is especially challenging because the detector must be
	completely transparent to the photons while still acquiring information
	about them. Recent progress in manipulating microwave photons in
	superconducting circuits has increased demand for a {QND} detector
	which operates in the gigahertz frequency range. Here we demonstrate
	a {QND} detection scheme which measures the number of photons inside
	a high quality-factor microwave cavity on a chip. This scheme maps
	a photon number onto a qubit state in a single-shot via qubit-photon
	logic gates. We verify the operation of the device by analyzing the
	average correlations of repeated measurements, and show that it is
	90\% {QND.} It differs from previously reported detectors because
	its sensitivity is strongly selective to chosen photon number states.
	This scheme could be used to monitor the state of a photon-based
	memory in a quantum computer.},
